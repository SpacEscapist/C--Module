# Overview

This program provides the user with a working Vehicle Rental app. It allows the user to add new vehicles and their status (such as Available, Rented, Repair, etc.), view current vehicle list and their status, view number of vehicles in inventory, and remove vehicles from the list. This program utilizes a main menu to allow the user to navigate the app's options. This program uses a Map to provide key/value pairs in a list. The key is the vehicle name and the value is the vehicle status. This program also uses the Vehicle class in order to create a new Vehicle object each time "Create New Vehicle" is selected.

This program was created to showcase my learning/understanding of the C++ language basics - using variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes and a data structure from STL (using map). This program was also created to showcase my ability to learn a new language within a short period of time (within 1-2 weeks).
